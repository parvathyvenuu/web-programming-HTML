                Hello! Myself Parvathy, and I am passionate about developing web pages. 
                In my free time, I enjoy capturing life around me. These activities not only 
                help me relax but also inspire creativity in my work.
</p>
<p>

                With 3 years of experience in the field, I have had the opportunity 
                to attend a few significant experiences or projects. These experiences have 
                shaped my skills.
</p>
<p>

                I believe in continuous learning and am always excited to take on new challenges. 
                Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or 
                discuss any projects.
            </p>
